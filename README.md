# ShareBnB

Share BnB is an web application to monetize and utilize front/backyard home assets which can be rented with a frictionless platform using the web appâ€™s system of finding potential matches based on geographical proximity. By streamlining the process of viewing local neighborhood outdoor assets such as swimming pools, yard, BBQ, driveways, tennis courts etc. with a simple web application. This is an untapped resource for the host to rent his outdoor facilities which can be monetized when not in use. Similar to AirBnb of collaborative consumption and sharing app but for the outside the home instead of inside. Host offer experiences and use of outdoor facilities instead of accommodation to guests by using a variety of filters types, dates, location and price. Before booking users must provide a valid name, email address and contact information.
